Later that evening on July 2, 2022 - The application is developed and works.  I am debating whether to add edit and delete functions.  When I first created this, I intentionally left those features out.. As it is a secret.  And you can't take back a secret right?!  Whatever.  I already created this as a branch and started on it in case I want to implement later.  (I think all you need to do is add the normal buttons that were there originally when you first scaffolded the secret model)
